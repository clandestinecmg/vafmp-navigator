# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We only support the latest `stable` branch snapshot. Older snapshots are not maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead:
1. Email the maintainer privately at: your-email@example.com
2. Include clear steps to reproduce and any proof of concept if possible.
3. Allow time for us to review and patch before public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep VAFMP Navigator safe.
